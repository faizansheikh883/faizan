                            In 1531, Henry VIII acquired the Hospital of St James, which became St James's Palace, from
                            Eton College, and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster AbbeyThese transfers
                            brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William
                            the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier Various owners leased it from royal
                            landlords, and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century.
                            By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was
                            mostly wasteland. Needing money, James I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained
                            part of the site on which he established a four-acre (1.6 ha) mulberry garden for the
                            production of silk. (This is at the north-west corner of today's palace.) Clement Walker in
                            Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to "new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden
                            at S. James's"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the
                            late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir Hugh Audley by
                            the great heiress Mary Davies.
                            Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir William Blake, around
                            1624 The next owner was Lord Goring, who from 1633 extended Blake's house, which came to be
                            known as Goring House, and developed much of today's garden, then known as Goring Great
                            GardenHe did not, however, obtain the freehold interest in the mulberry garden. Unbeknown to
                            Goring, in 1640 the document "failed to pass the Great Seal before Charles I fled London,
                            which it needed to do for legal executionIt was this critical omission that would help the
                            British royal family regain the freehold under George III. When the improvident Goring
                            defaulted on his rents, Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington was able to purchase the lease
                            of Goring House and he was occupying it when it burned down in 1674,[ following which he
                            constructed Arlington House on the site—the location of the southern wing of today's
                            palace—the next yearIn 1698, John Sheffield acquired the lease. He later became the first
                            Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. Buckingham House was built for Sheffield in 1703 to the
                            design of William Winde. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with
                            two smaller flanking service wings. It was eventually sold by Buckingham's illegitimate son,
                            Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1761 to George III for £21,000. Sheffield's leasehold on the
                            mulberry garden site, the freehold of which was still owned
                            by the royal family, was due to expire in 1774.Under the new royal ownership, the building
                            was originally intended as a private retreat for George III's wife, Queen Charlotte, and was
                            accordingly known as The Queen's House. Remodelling of the structure began in 1762In 1775,
                            an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte, in exchange for her rights to
                            nearby Somerset House,[21][e] and 14 of her 15 children were born there. Some furnishings
                            were transferred from Carlton House and others had been bought in France after the French
                            Revolutionof 1789. While St James's Palace remained the official and ceremonial royal
                            residence, the name "Buckingham-palace" was used from at least 1791After his accession to
                            the throne in 1820, George IV continued the renovation intending to create a small,
                            comfortable home. However, in 1826, while the work was in progress, the King decided to
                            modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash The external façade
                            was designed, keeping in mind the French neoclassical influence preferred by George IV. The
                            cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs
                            resulted in his removal as the architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger
                            brother William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work William never moved into the
                            palace. After the Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in 1834, he offered to convert
                            Buckingham
                            Palace into a new Houses of Parliament, but his offer was declinedBuckingham Palace became
                            the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoriawho was the first
                            monarch to reside there; her predecessor William IV had died before its completion. While
                            the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were
                            somewhat less luxurious. It was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to
                            be allowed to die down, and consequently the palace was often coldVentilation was so bad
                            that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious
                            worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax
                            and lazy and the palace was dirty Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband,
                            Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff,
                            and with addressing the design faults of the palaceBy the end of 1840, all the problems had
                            been rectified. However, the builders were to return within the decade.
                            By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family[
                            and a new wing, designed by Edward Blore, was built by Thomas Cubitt, enclosing the central
                            quadrangle. The large East Front, facing The Mall, is today the "public face" of Buckingham
                            Palace, and contains the balcony from which the royal family acknowledge the crowds on
                            momentous occasions and after the annual Trooping the Colour. The ballroom wing and a
                            further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash's student Sir
                            James Pennethorne. Before Prince Albert's death, the palace was frequently the scene of
                            musical entertainments,[36] and the most celebrated contemporary musicians entertained at
                            Buckingham Palace. The composer Felix Mendelssohn is known to have played there on three
                            occasions. Johann Strauss II and his orchestra played there when in England Under Victoria,
                            Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls, in addition to the usual
                            royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations
                            Widowed in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham
                            Palace to live at Windsor Castle, Balmoral Castle and Osborne House. For many years the
                            palace was seldom used, even neglected. In 1864, a note was found pinned to the fence of
                            Buckingham Palace, saying: "These commanding premises to be let or sold, in consequence of
                            the late occupant's declining business." Eventually, public opinion persuaded the Queen to
                            return to London, though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible. Court
                            functions were still held at Windsor Castle, presided over by the sombre Queen habitually
                            dressed in mourning black, while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year.
                            In 1901, the new king, Edward VII, began redecorating the palace. The King and his wife,
                            Queen Alexandra, had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends,
                            known as "the Marlborough House Set", were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable
                            of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase,
                            vestibules and galleries were redecorated in the Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme
                            they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but
                            leaving some to feel Edward's heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash's original work
                            The last major building work took place during the reign of George V when, in 1913, Sir
                            Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park
                            in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the
                            backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria created by
                            sculptor Sir Thomas Brock, erected outside the main gates on a surround constructed by
                            architect Sir Aston Web George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious
                            personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and
                            royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring
                            jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919; the first jazz performance
                            for a head of state), Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a
                            nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the
                            venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.
                            During the First World War, which lasted from 1914 until 1918, the palace escaped unscathed.
                            Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor, but the royal family remained in
                            residence. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much to the dismay of his guests and
                            household.] To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further and
                            ostentatiously lock the wine cellars and refrain from alcohol, to set a good example to the
                            supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe, and the King was left
                            unhappy at his enforced abstinence.
                            George V's wife, Queen Mary, was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the
                            Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had
                            many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style
                            chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the
                            ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was
                            also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.[ This room, 69 feet (21
                            metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed by Nash,
                            coffered with huge gilt console brackets.[ In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by
                            Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.
                            During the Second World War, which broke out in 1939, the palace was bombed nine timesThe
                            most serious and publicised incident destroyed the palace chapel in 1940. This event was
                            shown in cinemas throughout the United Kingdom to show the common suffering of rich and
                            poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while George VI and Queen Elizabeth (the future
                            Queen Mother) were in the palace, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed
                            War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen
                            were filmed inspecting their bombed home; it was at this time the Queen famously declared:
                            "I'm glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the East End in the face". The royal family
                            were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as The Sunday Graphic reported:
                            By the Editor: The King and Queen have endured the ordeal which has come to their subjects.
                            For the second time a German bomber has tried to bring death and destruction to the home of
                            Their Majesties ... When this war is over the common danger which King George and Queen
                            Elizabeth have shared with their people will be a cherished memory and an inspiration
                            through the years.
                            On 15 September 1940, known as Battle of Britain Day, an RAF pilot, Ray Holmes of No. 504
                            Squadron RAF rammed a German Dornier Do 17 bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace.
                            Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it. Holmes bailed out
                            and the aircraft crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station The bomber's engine
                            was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. The British pilot became a King's
                            Messenger after the war and died at the age of 90 in 2005. On VE Day—8 May 1945—the palace
                            was the centre of British celebrations. The King, the Queen, Princess Elizabeth (the future
                            Queen) and Princess Margaret appeared on the balcony, with the palace's blacked-out windows
                            behind them, to cheers from a vast crowd in The Mall.[ The damaged Palace was carefully
                            restored after the war by John Mowlem & Co.[

                                            The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3 m-high (1,815.3 ft) concrete
                                            communications and observation tower in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
                                            Built on the former Railway Lands, it was completed in 1976. Its name "CN"
                                            referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower.
                                            Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets
                                            prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to
                                            the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for real
                                            estate development.
                                            The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure
                                            for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj
                                            Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed
                                            by the Canton Tower. It is currently the ninth-tallest free-standing
                                            structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on
                                            land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of
                                            the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil
                                            Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers.
                                            It is a signature icon of Toronto's skylineand attracts more than two
                                            million international visitors annually. It houses several observation
                                            decks, a revolving restaurant at some 1,151 feet (351 m), and an
